# central_limit_theorem_illustration

An illustration of the central limit theorem. The code repeatedly draws samples (of three different sizes) from a set of underlying population distributions (some of which are very non-normal). A plot is then created showing that the sampling distribution of the mean gets more precise and more normal as the sample size increases, regardless of the (non)normality of the underlying population.

Created as an illustration for the 2021 'Introduction to Data Science' module in the School of Psychology, University of Birmingham.

Inspired by Agresti, Statistical Methods for the Social Sciences, 2018, 5th Ed., pg.100. I wrote the original code, which was refactored by Matthew Brett, and then modified again by me.
